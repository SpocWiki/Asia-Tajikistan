## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Dushanbe** is the capital and largest city of Tajikistan.  
> As of 2023, Dushanbe had a population of 1,228,400, with this population being largely Tajik. 
> Until 1929, the city was known in Russian as Dyushambe, 
> and from 1929 to 1961 as Stalinabad, after Joseph Stalin. 
> 
> Dushanbe is located in the Gissar Valley, bounded by the Gissar Range in the north and east 
> and the Babatag, Aktau, Rangontau and Karatau mountains in the south, 
> and has an elevation of 750–930 m. 
> The city is divided into four districts: Ismail Samani, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, and Shah Mansur.
>
> In ancient times, what is now or is close to modern Dushanbe 
> was settled by various empires and peoples, including Mousterian tool-users, 
> various neolithic cultures, the Achaemenid Empire, Greco-Bactria, the Kushan Empire, and Hephthalites. 
> 
> In the Middle Ages, more settlements began near modern-day Dushanbe 
> such as Hulbuk and its famous palace. 
> 
> From the 17th to early 20th century, Dushanbe grew into a market village 
> controlled at times by the Beg of Hisor, Balkh, and finally Bukhara, 
> before being conquered by the Russian Empire. 
> 
> Dushanbe was captured by the Bolsheviks in 1922, 
> and the town was made the capital of the Tajik Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic in 1924, 
> which commenced Dushanbe's development and rapid population growth 
> that continued until the Tajik Civil War. 
> 
> After the war, the city became capital of an independent Tajikistan 
> and continued its growth and development into a modern city, today home to many international conferences.
>
> Much of Dushanbe's education system dates from Soviet times and has a legacy of state control; 
> today the largest university in Dushanbe, the Tajik National University, is funded by the government. 
> 
> Dushanbe International Airport is the primary airport serving the city. 
> Other forms of transport include the trolleybus system dating from 1955, 
> the small rail system, and the roads that traverse the city. 
> 
> Dushanbe's electricity is primarily hydroelectric, produced by the Nurek Dam, 
> and the aging water system dates from 1932. 
> 
> Tajikistan's healthcare system is concentrated in Dushanbe, 
> meaning that the major hospitals of the country are in the city. 
> 
> The city makes up 20% of Tajikistan's GDP and has large industrial, financial, retail, and tourism sectors. 
> 
> Parks and main sights of the city include Victory Park, Rudaki Park, the Tajikistan National Museum, 
> the Dushanbe Flagpole, and the Tajikistan National Museum of Antiquities.
